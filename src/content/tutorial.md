# The Randomizer.fun Tutorial!

This guide will walk you through the main features of our application.

---

## 1. Getting Started: The Main Interface

The main screen is your hub for all randomization tools.

-   **Tool Navigation**: At the top, you'll find a list of all available randomizer tools. Simply click on any tool to open it.
-   **Random Feature Dice**: Feeling adventurous? Click the spinning dice icon next to the "Randomizer" title to jump to a completely random tool!

## 2. Using a Randomizer Tool

Each tool is designed to be simple and intuitive. Let's take the **List Randomizer** as an example:

1.  **Enter Your Items**: In the "List of Items" area, you can type your choices. Each choice should be on a new line.
2.  **Set the Count**: Use the "Number of Items to Pick" input to decide how many winners you want.
3.  **Randomize!**: Click the big "Randomize!" button at the bottom.
4.  **View the Result**: A new card will appear showing your randomly picked item(s). You can easily copy the result using the copy icon.

Most other tools follow a similar pattern: set your options, click the randomize button, and get your result!

## 3. Unlocking More Features with an Account

Some of our more advanced tools, especially those that use AI or external APIs (like the **YouTube Randomizer** or **OOTD Generator**), require you to be logged in.

-   **Login**: Click the "Login" button at the top left of the header. You can sign in quickly and securely with your Google account.
-   **Benefits**:
    -   Access to all tools.
    -   Your settings are saved! This includes your preferred theme (light/dark), the order of the tool menu, and your randomization settings for each tool.

## 4. Saving and Loading Presets (New!)

Tired of re-entering the same settings every time? Now you can save them as presets!

1.  **Set Up Your Tool**: Configure a tool with the parameters you use often (e.g., a list of names for the Team Shuffler, or a specific date range for the Date Randomizer).
2.  **Save Preset**: Click the "Save Current" button. A dialog will pop up asking you to name your preset. Give it a memorable name like "Weekly Standup Order" and click "Save Preset".
3.  **Load Preset**: The next time you visit that tool, click the "Load Preset" button. A dropdown menu will show all your saved presets for that specific tool.
4.  **Select a Preset**: Simply click on a preset name from the list. Your settings will be instantly loaded into the tool's input fields.
5.  **Manage Presets**: You can delete old presets by clicking the trash icon next to the preset name in the "Load Preset" dropdown.

This feature is only available for registered users.

## 5. Customizing Your Experience (Settings Page)

Once logged in, you can access the settings page from the user dropdown menu (click your profile picture).

-   **Animation Duration**: Control how long randomization animations (like dice rolls or spinners) last.
-   **Play Sounds**: Enable or disable the sound effects that play during randomization.
-   **Tools Order**: This is a powerful feature! You can drag and drop the tools to rearrange them in the main navigation bar. This lets you put your most-used tools first for quick access. The divider shows where the "Show More Tools" button will appear.


## 6. Keyboard Shortcuts (Power Users)

For those who want to move fast, we've added some keyboard shortcuts:

-   **Search**: `Ctrl + /` - Focus the search bar to quickly find a tool.
-   **Quick Navigation**: `Alt + 1` through `Alt + 9` - Switch to the 1st, 2nd, ... 9th tool in your menu order.
-   **Randomize Action**: `Ctrl + Enter` - Trigger the main "Randomize" / "Generate" button of the current tool.
