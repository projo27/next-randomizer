# Welcome to the Randomizer.fun Tutorial!

This guide will walk you through the main features of our application.

---

## 1. Getting Started: The Main Interface

The main screen is your hub for all randomization tools.

- **Tool Navigation**: At the top, you'll find a list of all available randomizer tools. Simply click on any tool to open it.
- **Random Feature Dice**: Feeling adventurous? Click the spinning dice icon next to the "Randomizer" title to jump to a completely random tool!

## 2. Using a Randomizer Tool

Each tool is designed to be simple and intuitive. Let's take the **List Randomizer** as an example:

1.  **Enter Your Items**: In the "List of Items" area, you can type your choices. Each choice should be on a new line.
2.  **Set the Count**: Use the "Number of Items to Pick" input to decide how many winners you want.
3.  **Randomize!**: Click the big "Randomize!" button at the bottom.
4.  **View the Result**: A new card will appear showing your randomly picked item(s). You can easily copy the result using the copy icon.

Most other tools follow a similar pattern: set your options, click the randomize button, and get your result!

## 3. Unlocking More Features with an Account

Some of our more advanced tools, especially those that use AI or external APIs (like the **YouTube Randomizer** or **OOTD Generator**), require you to be logged in.

- **Login**: Click the "Login" button at the top left of the header. You can sign in quickly and securely with your Google account.
- **Benefits**:
    - Access to all tools.
    - Your settings are saved! This includes your preferred theme (light/dark) and the order of the tool menu.

## 4. Customizing Your Experience (Settings Page)

Once logged in, you can access the settings page from the user dropdown menu (click your profile picture).

- **Animation Duration**: Control how long randomization animations (like dice rolls or spinners) last.
- **Play Sounds**: Enable or disable the sound effects that play during randomization.
- **Tools Order**: This is a powerful feature! You can drag and drop the tools to rearrange them in the main navigation bar. This lets you put your most-used tools first for quick access. The divider shows where the "Show More" button will appear.
